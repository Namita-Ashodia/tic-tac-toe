                     <p >An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, 
                         around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) 
                         and instead of having any number of pieces, 
                         each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. 
                         The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.
